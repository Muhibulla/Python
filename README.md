**Python Learning Journey**
This repository documents my journey of learning Python. I commit to studying and practicing Python for 2 hours each day. You may notice that some of the code files contain extensive comments; this is because I believe that pausing to explain and understand the code enhances the learning process.

In addition to daily learning, I will challenge myself to solve one Python programming challenge as part of my ongoing study. This repository serves as a record of my progress and growth as I embark on this Python learning adventure.
